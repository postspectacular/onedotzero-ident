# About #

[onedotzero](http://onedotzero.com) is an international moving image festival, showcasing a variety of work from innovators across the globe. This year's festival identity was created collaboratively by [Wieden+Kennedy](http://wk.com) & [Karsten Schmidt (PostSpectacular)](http://postspectacular.com). All identity assets were generated using a tailor made design/visualization tool, which has also been adapted to create a large scale (48m wide) interactive installation at BFI Southbank during the London festival. The installation allowed users to submit their own messages and manipulate them through gestural interactions using various features of the new [Maemo](http://maemo.nokia.com)/Linux based Nokia N900 device. The software client for the phone was developed by [Gary Birkett](http://liqbase.net/) and will be available under GPL (TBC) soon.

To complete the community ethos of our identity concept we decided to open source the entire generator, installation software & tools in the hope to encourage further discussion, educate and hopefully see some wonderful new additions/re-renderings of the whole concept...

**This space serves as the root repository for the original opensource version of the software developed by Karsten Schmidt & further development/remixing by the onedotzero community.**

If you're interested in having a go at [hacking the source](http://code.google.com/p/onedotzero-ident/source/browse/), we've spent a lot of time & effort to provide you with as much [documentation](DevelopmentGuide.md), comments & insights as possible in order to ease the challenge.

# Getting started #

Please see the [Installation](Installation.md) & [UserGuide](UserGuide.md) pages to get started. The documentation is almost complete, and more is available in the source code. More wiki documentation is also coming over the next couple of days, so be sure to check back.
